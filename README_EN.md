[Brazilian Portuguese](README.md)

BRAPA (Brazilian Phonetic Alphabet) is a phonetic alphabet made for synthesizers focused on the most common phonemes in Brazilian Portuguese.

Using [Arpabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET) as a base, its objective is to simplify the use of synthesizers by bringing a more intuitive and faster language, without the need to use special characters that can be obstacles for some types of training with Artificial Intelligences and for use in Singing and Voice Synthesizers.</br>
Its phoneme index is flexible and designed to be adapted to each region of the country and its accents, according to the user's needs.
